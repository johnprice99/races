-- BUGS --


* look at database calls when generating a race
* look at inconsistencies for doctrine mappings when generating a race


-- FUTURE CHANGES --


* make races hidden by default (private, until set to public - in case generation fails or something)
* horses of 2 years only race other 2 year old horses (and only short distances)
	- need to generate 2 year old horses now too?
