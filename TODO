* change male horses level based on whether they have been gelded or not
* Add colours to races - create some sort of colours generator? or is each colour associated with each owner?
* Make the odds change based on how many bets there are on a particular entry (dynamic odds)
* Ability to "buy" a horse and have it make money for you racing
* Add paypal integration as microtransaction - £1 per 10cr in-game money, options of £1/10, £10/150, £50/1000
