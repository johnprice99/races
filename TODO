-- BUGS --

* look at database calls when generating a race

-- FUTURE CHANGES --

* Add paypal integration as microtransaction
* Make the odds change based on how many bets there are on a particular entry (dynamic odds)
* Ability to "buy" a horse and have it make money for you racing
* Add colours to races - create some sort of colours generator? or is each colour associated with each owner?
* Add "going" to races and horses - better matches will give bonus to win race
* make races hidden by default (private, until set to public - in case generation fails or something)
* horses of 2 years only race other 2 year old horses (and only short distances)
	- need to generate 2 year old horses now too?
